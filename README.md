# dial_back

Dial Back is a dynamic website that uses NodeJS, ReactJS, and the Twitter API to display a gallery of pictures that people are tweeting relating to a given hashtag.

This was created by Gabriel Fasching, Omer Kandemir, and Tyler Thompson for Harvard University's HackHarvard 2022.

For now it lies uncompleted because of time constraints, but we may continue to add features in the future.
